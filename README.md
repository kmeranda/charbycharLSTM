This program creates a character by character LSTM using tensorflow 0.11.0 which trains on an input file and generates output based on the format of the input. The default file provided, 'train.txt', contains 1600+ Christmas songs written in ABC Notation. An MP3 of an example output 'When Christ Was Born Of Pure Marie.mp3', is provided to demonstrate the neural network's capability after only 20 training epochs.

use the command python lstm.py -h for all argument options available for this file.
